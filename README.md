# Webpage & Blog (MERN)
Personal webpage & blog built with MERN (MongoDB ExpressJS ReactJS NodeJS) stack application. Currently under construction.

## How It Works (Visited Side)
Other than blog pages are static pages but blog pages are dynamically created. Visiters can view shared posts with navigation in navbar.
Like so a visiter can be logged in by clicking "Admin Giris" button at the end of the navbar. Shared post's content can be viewed by pressing "DEVAMINI OKU" button.
Those posts are stored in MongoDB and revelaed in dynamic pages.

## How It Works (Admin Side)
Admins can be logged in by clicking "ADMIN GIRIS" button. Login functionality takes place with JSON Web tokens in backend and React Redux in frontend. 
After logging in new options becomes available. Admins can share new posts, update and delete (CRUD operations) existing posts.
